42. Trapping Rain Water
https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/description/
1st: 2025-03-15

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of 
each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

Example 1:
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6

Example 2:
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

Constraints:
    n == height.length
    1 <= n <= 2 * 104
    0 <= height[i] <= 105
"""

# 1st Attempt
# LOGIC: Using two pointer, calculate with lower height and move the pointer to the higher height.
# Time : O(n)  |  Space: O(1)
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height) - 1
        left_max = height[left]
        right_max = height[right]
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if left_max < right_max:
                left += 1
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water += left_max - height[left]
            else:
                right -= 1
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water += right_max - height[right]
        return water
