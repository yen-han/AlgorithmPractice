3767. Maximize Points After Choosing K Tasks
https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-points-after-choosing-k-tasks/
1st 2026-01-29

You are given two integer arrays, technique1 and technique2, each of length n, 
where n represents the number of tasks to complete.

    If the ith task is completed using technique 1, you earn technique1[i] points.
    If it is completed using technique 2, you earn technique2[i] points.

You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of tasks 
that must be completed using technique 1.

You must complete at least k tasks using technique 1 (they do not need 
to be the first k tasks).

The remaining tasks may be completed using either technique.

Return an integer denoting the maximum total points you can earn.

Example 1:
Input: technique1 = [5,2,10], technique2 = [10,3,8], k = 2
Output: 22

Example 2:
Input: technique1 = [10,20,30], technique2 = [5,15,25], k = 2
Output: 60

Constraints
1 <= n == technique1.length == technique2.length <= 10^5
1 <= technique1[i], technique2​​​​​​​[i] <= 10​​​​​​​^5
0 <= k <= n

# 1st Attempt
# LOGIC: Sort the tasks based on the difference of points between technique1 and technique2 in descending order.
# Time : O(n log n)  | Space: O(n)
class Solution:
    def maxPoints(self, technique1: List[int], technique2: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        tech_set = []
        for i in range(len(technique1)):
            tech_set.append([technique1[i]- technique2[i], technique1[i], technique2[i]])

        tech_set.sort(reverse=True)

        res = 0
        for i in range(k):
            res += tech_set[i][1]
        for i in range(k, len(technique1)):
            res += max(tech_set[i][1], tech_set[i][2])
        return res
